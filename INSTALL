This has been tested only under MPE/iX 6.0

Try to get the latest GNU gcc build from jazz (http://jazz.external.hp.com)
This was tested with the 20 December 2000 build.  Some earlier builds do
not have a correct 'ld' command.

The usual command sequence should work:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
